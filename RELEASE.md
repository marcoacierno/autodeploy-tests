Release type: patch







OK I ADDED A FEW SPACES BEFORE THIS THEY SHOULD NOT EXIST. ALSO ADDED TWO SPACES BELOW THIS


THEY SHOULD EXIST!!! This is python code:

```
class Hello:
    this: int = 1
    is: string = "very"
    convincing: float = 3.14

    def code(self):
        a = None

        if a:
            very = "complex"

        return "This is a string instead"
```

Hello!

```
you
never
know
```

what happens
next

I ADDED MORE SPACES BELOW THIS, THEY SHOULD NOT EXIST OK?
